# Vue To-Do

A simple to-do list built with Vue.

## Design

1. Provide an input field for new to-do items.

2. List existing to-do items.

## Behavior

1. Don't require the user to click a button to add a to-do item. Add the current text automatically when they press "enter."

2. Provide a "remove" button so to-do items can be removed when they are complete.
